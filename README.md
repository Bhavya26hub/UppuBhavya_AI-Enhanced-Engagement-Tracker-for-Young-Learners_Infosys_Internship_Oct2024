# OpenCV_projects
This repo contains Image processing projects using python (OpenCV library).

### Installing Libraries

```cmd
pip install numpy
pip install opencv
pip install times

```
-> We use numpy library as it contains a multi-dimensional array and matrix data structures. It can be utilised to perform a number of mathematical operations on arrays such as trigonometric, statistical, and algebraic routines.
-> We use OpenCV library because it is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.

----

1.Coloring the image

Before coloring

These are some ImageProcessing Techniques I have done

#Video Processsing Techniques

 Save - saving the captured videos By WebCams

 FPS -The FPS (frames per second) of video processing refers to the number of individual frames (or images) a system can process per second
Video Stacking - adding the both videos
## It includes following projects
----
----
1. Add text to video stream
2.  Accessing webcam and record video

The outputs of above video processing techniques provided itself in the video_processing folder

#Annotations

Labeling the images like
